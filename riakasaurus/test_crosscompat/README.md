Cross-compatibility tests
=======

These tests try to verify the operation of the standard riak-python-client library by calling various things and seeing how much API coverage we have in comparison. 
This is not to say Riakasaurus _needs_ to be analogous to riak-python-client (who change their entire API more frequently than I change my pants), but it should be a principal of "least surprise"
